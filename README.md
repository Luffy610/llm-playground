# 🤖 LLM Playground

A collection of mini projects and experiments exploring the capabilities of Generative AI, LLMs, and RAG architectures — built for rapid learning, prototyping, and sharing ideas.

# 🧪 What Is This?
This is my personal playground for GenAI. Each subproject here is a self-contained module or app designed to explore:

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

- WebSocket-based conversational agents

- Gemini, OpenAI, and local LLM integrations

- File-based assistants and vector stores

- Streamlit, LangChain, LlamaIndex, and beyond
